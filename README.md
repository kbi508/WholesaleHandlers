#App Description: This app is designed to help a store manager with restocking inventory. The manager would have a file containing all the items
#of the store with would have all of the information that an Item object contains, including the maximum amount, and price. The user would go through
#each item and input the current amount. Once you go through this process with all items that you want, the app calculate how man of each item you need
#to buy and output a "receipt" with the total cost for all of those items.

#There is one file requirement of the items which will be provided since it is format specific. One button on the main page will allow you to 
#navigate through your file explorer to get to the file.
